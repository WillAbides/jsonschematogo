# Contributing to jsonschematogo

Your contributions are welcome here. Feel free to open issues and pull requests.
If you have a non-trivial change, you may want to open an issue before spending
much time coding, so we can discuss whether the change will be a good fit for
jsonschematogo. But don't let that stop you from coding. Just be aware that
while all changes are welcome, not all will be merged.
